# Kubernetes & Minikube ‚Äì Detailed Notes

## üåê What is Kubernetes?
- **Definition**: Kubernetes (K8s) is a container orchestration platform that automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **Why it‚Äôs used**:
  - Automates container scheduling across nodes.
  - Handles scaling (up/down) automatically.
  - Provides self-healing (restarts failed pods).
  - Manages networking (service discovery, DNS).
  - Supports rolling updates and rollbacks.

---

## üèó Kubernetes Architecture
- **Control Plane Components**:
  - **kube-apiserver** ‚Üí entrypoint for all commands (`kubectl` talks to this).
  - **etcd** ‚Üí distributed key-value store (cluster state).
  - **kube-scheduler** ‚Üí assigns pods to nodes based on resources.
  - **kube-controller-manager** ‚Üí ensures desired state (replicas, nodes).
- **Node Components**:
  - **kubelet** ‚Üí agent on each node, manages pods/containers.
  - **kube-proxy** ‚Üí handles networking/routing rules for pods.
  - **Container runtime** ‚Üí Docker/Containerd/CRI-O, actually runs containers.

---

## üñ• Practicing Locally with Minikube
- **Minikube** simulates a Kubernetes cluster locally (1-node).
- **Installation (Linux)**:
  ```bash
  curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
  sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
  ```
- **Start cluster**:
  ```bash
  minikube start --driver=docker
  ```
- **Check cluster**:
  ```bash
  kubectl get nodes
  kubectl get pods -A
  ```

- **Clean up the existing Minikube cluster**:
  ```bash
  minikube stop
  minikube delete
  minikube start --driver=docker
  ```

---

## üì¶ Pods
- Smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.
- Encapsulates **one or more containers** + shared resources (network, storage).
- Commands:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods
  kubectl logs <pod-name>
  kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/sh
  kubectl delete pod <pod-name>
  ```

---

## üìë Deployments
- Manages replicas of Pods (via ReplicaSets).
- Supports scaling, rolling updates, rollbacks.
- Key elements:
  - **apiVersion**: apps/v1
  - **kind**: Deployment
  - **metadata**: name, labels
  - **spec.replicas**: number of pods
  - **spec.selector**: which pods this Deployment manages
  - **spec.template**: defines pod spec (containers, env, ports)
- Scaling:
  ```bash
  kubectl scale deployment log-panda-app1 --replicas=5
  ```
- Deleting:
  ```bash
  kubectl delete deployment log-panda-app1
  ```

---

## üè∑ Pods vs Deployments vs ReplicaSets vs StatefulSets
- **Pod** ‚Üí single instance of your container(s).
- **ReplicaSet** ‚Üí ensures a specific number of pods are running (not used directly, managed by Deployment).
- **Deployment** ‚Üí manages ReplicaSets, enables scaling + rolling updates. Good for stateless apps (like app1/app2/app3).
- **StatefulSet** ‚Üí manages stateful apps (DBs, Kafka, etc.), gives stable identity + persistent storage.

---

## üîå Services
- Abstraction to expose Pods internally/externally.
- Types:
  - **ClusterIP (default)** ‚Üí internal-only.
  - **NodePort** ‚Üí exposes on each node‚Äôs IP:port (range 30000‚Äì32767). Used in dev, rarely in prod.
  - **LoadBalancer** ‚Üí provisions external LB (on cloud providers).
- Industry practice:
  - Internal services ‚Üí ClusterIP
  - External access ‚Üí Ingress + LoadBalancer

---

## üåê Ingress
- Manages external access via **hostnames/paths**.
- Requires an **Ingress Controller** (NGINX, Traefik, etc.).
- In Minikube:
  ```bash
  minikube addons enable ingress
  ```
- Use `/etc/hosts` to map `app1.local` ‚Üí Minikube IP.

---

## üê≥ Docker Images & Kubernetes
- Pods pull images from registries (Docker Hub, GCP, ECR, etc.).
- Workflow:
  1. Build image locally ‚Üí `docker build -t username/app1:v1.0.0 .`
  2. Test locally ‚Üí `docker run -p 3000:3000 username/app1:v1.0.0`
  3. Push to Docker Hub ‚Üí  
     ```bash
     docker login
     docker push username/app1:v1.0.0
     ```
  4. Reference in Deployment YAML under `image:`.

---

## üìã Environment Variables in Pods
- Set directly in Deployment YAML under `spec.containers.env`.
- Precedence: **Deployment env vars > Image baked `.env` in src dir**.
- Example:
  ```yaml
  env:
    - name: PORT
      value: "3000"
  ```

---

## ‚è≥ Jobs
- A Job ensures that **a pod runs to completion** (used for batch tasks like data processing, migrations, one-time jobs).
- Unlike Deployments (which keep pods running), Jobs **terminate once done**.
- Can be parallelized with `.spec.parallelism` and `.spec.completions`.

---

## üõ† Useful Commands Recap
```bash
kubectl get pods                # list pods
kubectl get svc                 # list services
kubectl logs -f <pod>              # view pod logs [if there are multiple containers running within a pod, then this will fetch the logs of first container by default]
kubectl exec -it <pod> -- sh    # shell inside container
kubectl apply -f file.yaml      # apply manifest
kubectl delete -f file.yaml     # delete resource
minikube ip                     # get Minikube IP
minikube ssh                    # login to node
minikube service <svc-name>     # open service in browser
```

## Kafka in Kubernetes (Production Considerations)
- Kafka is **stateful** and tightly coupled with storage & networking performance.
- Running Kafka on Kubernetes is possible but adds complexity.
- Typical issues:
  - Scaling **up** requires **manual partition reassignment** (Kafka does not automatically rebalance partitions).
  - Scaling **down** is risky (must safely move partitions off brokers).
  - StatefulSets + PVCs help, but **dynamic scaling like stateless apps is not feasible**.

### Options for Production Kafka
1. **Managed Kafka Services (Preferred)**  
   - AWS MSK, Confluent Cloud, Aiven, Redpanda Cloud.  
   - Pros: No operational burden, automatic scaling, monitoring, and upgrades.

2. **Self-Hosted Kafka (on VMs or Bare Metal)**  
   - Run on dedicated servers with tuned SSD/NVMe disks.
   - Greater control over performance, but more maintenance overhead.

3. **Kafka in Kubernetes (with Operators)**  
   - Tools like **Strimzi Operator** or **Confluent Operator** automate broker lifecycle, upgrades, and partition reassignment.  
   - Suitable if an organization standardizes on Kubernetes for all infra.  
   - Still requires careful planning for scaling.

## Key Takeaways
- **Don‚Äôt treat Kafka like a Deployment** ‚Üí It cannot auto-scale seamlessly.
- **KRaft removes ZooKeeper** but does **not** eliminate scaling complexity.
- For learning and small setups ‚Üí running Kafka in Kubernetes is fine.  
- For production ‚Üí **prefer managed Kafka** or a well-maintained operator.



## Headless Services in Kubernetes
- A Service with `clusterIP: None` is called a **Headless Service**.
- Instead of a single ClusterIP for load-balancing, it returns the **DNS records of individual Pods** behind it.
- Useful for StatefulSets like Kafka, where clients need to talk to specific brokers by stable DNS names (e.g., `kafka-0.service-name:9092`).


## üåÄ Headless Services (`clusterIP: None`)

Normally, when you create a **Service** in Kubernetes:

- It gets a **ClusterIP** (a single **virtual IP / VIP**).  
- Clients connect to the Service IP, and kube-proxy does load balancing across the Pods that match the Service selector.  
- Example:
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc log-panda-app1-service
  ```
  Output:
  ```
  NAME                      TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    PORT(S)    AGE
  log-panda-app1-service    ClusterIP   10.96.120.47  3000/TCP   5m
  ```
  Here, `10.96.120.47` is the **VIP**. DNS (`log-panda-app1-service.default.svc.cluster.local`) resolves to that single VIP.

---

### üîé What happens with `clusterIP: None`?
If you set:
```yaml
spec:
  clusterIP: None
```

- Kubernetes does **not assign a ClusterIP**.  
- Instead, the Service name directly resolves to the **individual Pod IPs** that match the selector.  
- Example with a StatefulSet (`kafka` with 3 replicas):

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=kafka -o wide
```
Output:
```
NAME       READY   STATUS    IP           NODE
kafka-0    1/1     Running   10.244.0.12  worker-1
kafka-1    1/1     Running   10.244.1.15  worker-2
kafka-2    1/1     Running   10.244.2.20  worker-3
```

Now do a DNS lookup:
```bash
kubectl run -it --rm dnsutils --image=infoblox/dnstools -- nslookup kafka
```

Output:
```
Server:    10.96.0.10
Address 1: 10.96.0.10 kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local

Name:   kafka.default.svc.cluster.local
Address: 10.244.0.12
Address: 10.244.1.15
Address: 10.244.2.20
```

üëâ Instead of one VIP, you get **all Pod IPs**.

---

### ‚ö° Why is this useful?
- For **StatefulSets (Kafka, ZooKeeper, DBs, etc.)** where each Pod has a stable identity.  
- Clients often need to talk to a **specific broker** (not just load-balanced).  
- Kubernetes gives each StatefulSet Pod a stable DNS name:
  ```
  kafka-0.kafka.default.svc.cluster.local
  kafka-1.kafka.default.svc.cluster.local
  kafka-2.kafka.default.svc.cluster.local
  ```
- This way, producers/consumers can directly connect to `kafka-0`, `kafka-1`, etc., instead of being routed randomly.

---

‚úÖ In short:  
- **Normal Service (ClusterIP)** ‚Üí One VIP, kube-proxy load balances.  
- **Headless Service (`clusterIP: None`)** ‚Üí No VIP, DNS returns **Pod IPs**. Perfect for StatefulSets.
